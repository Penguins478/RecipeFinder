## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. Recipe Finder
   - **Description**: This app helps users discover recipes based on ingredients they already have, dietary needs, cuisine preferences, or time available. Encourages home cooking and reduces food waste. It adds a little fun to cooking as well as you don't know what recipe you're gonna get as well.
   - **Category:** Food & Drink
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for on-the-go recipe lookup, kitchen use while cooking. Could possibly have notifications for daily mail ideas. Theoretically, one could also use the camera and scan a food item to make sure its including in the recipe.  
   - **Story:** Solves the question of "what should I cook/eat today?" problem. Allows users to explore new meals quickly and it encourages creativity, exploration, and possibly healthier eating habits.
   - **Market:** The market is huge and for anyone who cooks at home including college students, parents, etc. 
   - **Habit:** We could make it a habit for users to check the app by having daily suggestions via push notifications, favorite recipes saved and re-used, along with weekly cooking goals/challenges. Essentially, it could be used multiple times per week, especially at mealtimes.
   - **Scope:** It would be very technically challenging to complete this app but a stripped down version would still be interesting to make. We could make it where a user is recommended a random recipe and they can ask for a new one or favorite the recipe. There could be two modes where the user can ask for a random recipe (not including their favorites) or just filter it down to their favorites. 

2. Music Playlist
   - **Description**: This app goes beyond a simple music player by utilizing real-time audio streaming, offline playback, and push notifications to enhance user engagement. It also integrates background listening, ensuring a smooth experience even when switching between tasks or devices.
   - **Category:** Entertainment / Music Streaming
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for the instant logging of songs. 
   - **Story:** The app serves as an intelligent playlist builder that adapts to users’ moods and habits, making music discovery effortless. Users can create, share, and collaborate on playlists, fostering a social experience that keeps them engaged. The clear value proposition—smart, personalized playlists—makes it highly appealing to both casual listeners and music enthusiasts.
   - **Market:** The global music streaming industry is massive, with millions of active users seeking a more tailored listening experience. The app provides significant value by offering hyper-personalized playlists, which cater to both mainstream and niche audiences. With strong demand for smarter curation, the user base has vast growth potential.
   - **Habit:** Music is an everyday habit, and this app encourages frequent use through daily playlist updates, smart recommendations, and social engagement. Users don’t just consume content—they actively build and refine their music collections, making the experience more immersive.
   - **Scope:** A minimum viable product with playlist creation, smart recommendations, and sharing capabilities would still be compelling. While integrating AI-driven suggestions and seamless cross-device experiences presents technical challenges, the core concept is well-defined and feasible to develop.

3. Flashcards
   - **Description**: This app leverages real-time syncing, push notifications, and spaced repetition algorithms to ensure effective learning on the go. It integrates audio for pronunciation practice, camera scanning for automatic card creation, and even gesture-based interactions for quick studying.

   - **Market:** The education and self-improvement market is vast, with millions of students, professionals, and knowledge seekers looking for effective study tools. This app provides immense value to a dedicated niche, especially those preparing for standardized tests, medical exams, and language proficiency certifications.
   - **Habit:** Learning is most effective when consistent, and this app encourages daily use through customized study reminders, gamification elements, and progress tracking. Users don’t just consume content—they actively create their own flashcards, reinforcing long-term engagement.
   - **Scope:** A stripped-down version with basic flashcard creation, spaced repetition, and progress tracking would still be useful and engaging. More advanced features, like AI-generated quizzes and community-shared decks, add complexity but are achievable as future updates. The product vision is well-defined, making development focused and structured.
