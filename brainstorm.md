   - **Category:** Food & Drink
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for on-the-go recipe lookup, kitchen use while cooking. Could possibly have notifications for daily mail ideas. Theoretically, one could also use the camera and scan a food item to make sure its including in the recipe.

   - **Habit:** Anyone who cooks at home including college students, parents, etc. 
   - **Scope:** It would be very technically challenging to complete this app but a stripped down version would still be interesting to make. We could make it where a user is recommended a random recipe and they can ask for a new one or favorite the recipe. There could be two modes where the user can ask for a random recipe (not including their favorites) or just filter it down to their favorites. 

2. Music Playlist

   - **Scope:** A minimum viable product with playlist creation, smart recommendations, and sharing capabilities would still be compelling. While integrating AI-driven suggestions and seamless cross-device experiences presents technical challenges, the core concept is well-defined and feasible to develop.

3. Flashcards
   - **Description**: This app leverages real-time syncing, push notifications, and spaced repetition algorithms to ensure effective learning on the go.
